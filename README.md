## Introduction
Making games in Javascript is cool to see but equally hectic to complete! So this time I came up with learning to make **mini games** using Javascript and an easy to use (yet rarely used) Javascript library p5.js.This library is used for creative coding and making animations easy.
## Instructions
* Use the left and right arrow keys to move the bun around
* Toppings are falling! Catch as many as you can
* Game ends when you miss a topping
* To play again,press f5 or just refresh the page
* Enjoy!
P.S- This game is void of good design and colors because my sole motive of making it was to learn and implement quickly.
